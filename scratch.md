So as final project, what do I want to do?
I'd say, for now, at the minimum, I want a website that:

- makes use of an API
- can change its theme
- lets user log in or register
- has a real-time search function
- (has collection of minigames maybe)
- is deployed on the internet for everyone to use like on Heroku

Ideas:

- a dashboard with time and weather through an API, focus and tasks for the day
- let someone upload a CSV or sth and visualization is realized automatically
- ...
