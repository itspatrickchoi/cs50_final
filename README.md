## Fun Facts

### Lines of code? Probably 1000+

- 53+304+11+110+94+119+164+220+55+15+12+123+307=1587
- The signin/signup/success HTML files have used especially many more lines than technically needed because of formatting
- So deduct around 135 lines
- There are inevitably also some empty lines and several comments
- Approx. no. of lines: **1000+**

### What did I learn?

#### Patience

The CS50 course was a long and challenging journey which took me countless hours. But I persevered and continued. I doubt even half of the people who started the course actually finished it. In the end, it was a fruitful experience that let me learn a lot. So takeaway? Good things take time.

#### Growth Mindset

Closely linked to patience is the incredible progress you see throughout the journey and thus the improvement potential one can possess. It is honestly crazy for me to think I started with just building simple Super Mario staircase blocks in a certain constellation through algorithms, and progressed to building image filters from scratch over to playing detective investigating a crime with SQL over to building a full-stack web application letting people buy/sell virtual stocks with real-time prices. It just goes to show what one can achieve if one commits to improving. Growth mindset ftw!
